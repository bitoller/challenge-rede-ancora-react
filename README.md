# CHALLENGE - REDE ANCORA

In response to the challenge proposed by Rede Ancora, in partnership with our academic institution, we developed an innovative totem project using React. This totem was created for the Rede Ancora stores and offers an interactive experience to the users, with several functionalities aimed at facilitating access to information about products and services.

<b>This project was awarded first place at the FIAP college fair, NEXT.</b>

## üî® Project Functionalities

The developed totem consists of various screens, each with specific functionalities:

### Home

The initial screen of the totem allows users to start using the device. In addition, it presents two links: one for the pitch video of our idea and another for information about the project, including the names of the group members.

### Search Screen

This screen offers two search options: by car license plate or by product name/code. Depending on the user's choice, they will be directed to the corresponding screen to perform the search.

- Search by license plate: Users can search any car license plate, and the API provided by Rede Ancora will provide information about the vehicle. From there, users can search for related products.
- Search by name or code: Users can search products or parts using name or code, and will be directed to a page with the product listing, filtering by the search criteria.

### Products Screen

On this page, users can view detailed information about the available products, including prices, images, and other characteristics. They can also add products to the shopping cart, search for other products, and explore the available options.

### Purchase Summary Screen

After adding products to the cart, users can view a summary of their selection, where they have the option to add more products, adjust the selected quantities, and check the purchase total.

### Checkout Screen

On the checkout page, users can choose the payment method and, if they wish, add their CPF to receive a discount on the purchase. They can review the total purchase before finalizing the purchase process.
